## JSX Prevents Injection Attacks

It is safe to embed user input in JSX:

const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>;

By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them.
Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything thatâ€™s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered.
This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks.

ex.)this might be a bed practice....

const element = <h1>"something to be title"</h1>;

## meaning of props
const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
);

is equivalent to

const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
);

and React.createElement creates object like this:

const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
};
